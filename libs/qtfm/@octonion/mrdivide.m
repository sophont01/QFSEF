function r = mrdivide(a, b)
% /   Slash or right matrix divide.
% (Octonion overloading of standard Matlab function.)
%
% This function is implemented only for the case in which the
% second parameter is a scalar. In this case, the result is as
% given by the ./ function.   The reason for implementing this
% function is that some Matlab code uses / when ./ should have
% been used.    See, for example, the function cov.m in Matlab
% versions up to (at least) 7.0.4.365 (R14) Service Pack 2.
