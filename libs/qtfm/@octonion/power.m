% This function can handle left and right parameters of the same size, or
% cases where one or other is a scalar.  The general case of a matrix or
% vector raised to a matrix or vector power requires elementwise operations
% and is handled using a general formula using logarithms, even though some
% of the elements of the right argument may be special cases (discussed
% below).

% When the right operand is a scalar, some special cases are handled using
% specific formulae because of the greater accuracy or better speed
% available. E.g. for Y == -1, the elementwise inverse is used, for Y == 2,
% elementwise squaring is used.

% For a power of ± 1/2, the sqrt function is used, with or without a
% reciprocal.

    % X is a scalar, but Y is not (otherwise it would have been handled
    % above). The general case code will handle this, since it will expand

    % R2016b, 'compatible' has a looser interpretation based on implicit
    % singleton expansion. Rather than try to check for compatibility here,
    % we have removed the size check and we leave it to the Matlab code to
    % raise and error if the sizes are incompatible.
