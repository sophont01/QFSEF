<h1>Quaternion Toolbox Documentation</h1>
<p>The authors of the toolbox, Stephen J. Sangwine and Nicolas Le Bihan,
retain copyright in the software and the documentation but grant rights
to others under the terms of the licences listed below.</p>
<p>
The toolbox is specifically designed to work with Matlab&reg;, which is a
proprietary closed-source software system. This means that, to use the
Quaternion Toolbox as its designers intended, you must execute the code of
the toolbox in conjunction
with proprietary Matlab&reg; code (known as &lsquo;linking&rsquo;).
The authors of the toolbox explicitly
grant permission for you to do this (for an FAQ on this topic, see the link
given below). Of course, since the toolbox is
licensed under the GNU GPL, you are free to do other things permitted by
that license, for example, running the code under GNU Octave
which is itself licensed under the GNU GPL.
</p>
<h2>Licenses</h2>
<p>The source code of the Quaternion Toolbox is licensed under the<br>
<a href="../gpl.txt">GNU General Public Licence</a>, currently version 3.</p>
<p>Documentation for the Quaternion Toolbox is licensed under the<br>
<a href="../fdl.txt">GNU Free Documentation License</a>, currently version 1.3.
<p>Copies of both licenses are distributed with the toolbox
(in files called <code>gpl.txt</code> and <code>fdl.txt</code>). They are referenced
