<code>frenet(q)</code>
computes the Frenet-Serret frames of a quaternion sequence or curve.
</para>
<para>
    Given a vector of quaternions (full or pure), representing a curve in
    3-space, 4-space or spacetime, this function computes the
    vectors of tangents, normals, binormals, and trinormals and the curvatures.
    The output parameters are as follows. The first four results are unit
    quaternions; the remaining four are scalars.
    <code>T</code> are the tangents;
    <code>N1</code> are the normals;
    <code>N2</code> are the binormals;
    <code>N3</code> are the trinormals;
    <code>J</code> is the moduli of the tangents,
    so that non-unit tangents are <code>J .* T</code>;
    <code>K</code> is the curvature; again <code>K .* N1</code>
    gives un-normalised normals;
    <code>L</code> is the second curvature or torsion;
    <code>M</code> is the third curvature or bitorsion.
</para>
<para>Note that the first and last values of <code>T</code> are not necessarily meaningful
because <code>T</code> is an approximation to the derivative, and therefore cannot be
correctly computed for the first and last values in <code>q</code>. The same applies
to <code>N1</code>, <code>N2</code> and <code>N3</code>,
but as these are computed using successive derivatives,
additional values at the extremities are not necessarily meaningful.

        Comments on references: the article by Bharathi and Nagaraj was probably the first to
        explain the Frenet-Serret frames in 4-space using quaternions, but the
        Wikipedia article makes clear that Camille Jordan worked out the
        n-dimensional case in 1874. The article by Kurt Nalty is of value for its
        clear tutorial explanation of the formulae.
