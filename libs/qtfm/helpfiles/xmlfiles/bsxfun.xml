This function is provided in order to support 
certain &matlab; functions, particularly
<code>var</code>, <code>std</code>, <code>cov</code> and <code>kron</code>
which use
<code>bsxfun</code> to apply arithmetic operators to intermediate results.
<code>bsxfun</code> was introduced in &matlab; Version 7.4 (R2007a). Prior
to that release the <code>var</code>, <code>std</code> and <code>cov</code>
functions worked with quaternions, but the introduction of <code>bsxfun</code>
broke this.
</para>
    <para>
        The implementation is fairly crude and may use considerable memory for large
        array inputs. This is not a fundamental issue, as there is scope in
        the code to perform the processing in chunks, to reduce memory use,
        and this may be done in a later release.
