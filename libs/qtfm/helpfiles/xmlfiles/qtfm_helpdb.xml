<code>qtfm_helpdb</code> runs a &matlab; function that constructs a
searchable database from the QTFM help information. If the database already
exists, it is replaced with a newly created version. These databases are
specific to the version of &matlab; that created them, so if you upgrade to
a new version of &matlab; you should re-run this function. The database is
not distributed with the toolbox because of this specific link to the &matlab;
version that created it.
