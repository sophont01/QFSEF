function S = randf(mu, kappa, varargin)
% RANDF   Returns unit vectors (pure quaternions) distributed on the sphere
% according to a Fisher distribution (a special case of the more general
% von Mises-Fisher distributions). See also RANDVMF for the 4-sphere case.
%
% The first parameter must be a pure quaternion, defining the direction of
% the centre of the distribution. The second parameter is the concentration
% parameter which controls the spread of the distribution on the sphere. It
% must be non-negative. A value of zero results in a uniform distribution
% on the sphere. Larger values result in greater concentration of the
% distribution in the mean direction mu.
%
% The remaining parameters are as for the Matlab function rand (q.v.).  The
% result may be scalar, vector, matrix or array depending on the parameters
% supplied.  Each pure quaternion returned is the result of at least two
% calls on rand, and two calls on randn, and hence randf modifies the state
% of the generator used by both rand and randn. To initialise the generator
% or control the choice of generator, use rand and/or randn.

% This code was rearranged in January 2016 (CVS revision 1.7) to vectorise
% the calculation of S. A side effect of this change is that calls to rand
% and randn are done in a different order to previous versions, which means
% that the function will not produce the same random values as it did, even
% if the random number generator has the same initial value.

                        % linear indexing for simplicity.

% TODO Each element of w requires a small number of iterations, possibly
% only one. This makes it hard to vectorise the code, and for the moment,
% we adopt a non-vectorised approach. However, the part of the code that
% does the main computation is now vectorised and to vectorise the
% remaining code would not be too difficult. Profiling reveals that very
% little time is spent in this loop (check).

% We now need to create a point on the unit circle, uniformly

% S now has elements with the Fisher distribution, but mean direction
% (0,0,1) i.e. aligned with qk or the z-axis. We must now rotate the
% elements of S by the rotation that takes qk to mu. NB mu is not
% necessarily a unit pure quaternion, therefore the rotation is coded using
% the inverse on the right and not the conjugate.

q = sqrt(mu ./ qk);
S = vector(q .* S .* inv(q)); % We take the vector part, because the
                              % rotation gives a zero scalar part
                              % (theoretically).
