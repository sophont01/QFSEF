function m = spherical_mean(q, tol)
% SPHERICAL_MEAN Computes the spherical mean, m, of the elements of q.
% This is a unit quaternion that minimises the sum of geodesic distances
% from m to unit versions of the elements of q. The second (optional)
% parameter is an angular tolerance on the result (in radians).
% q must be a vector (it may be pure or full quaternion(s)) and tol mus be
% a numeric scalar between 0 and 1.
