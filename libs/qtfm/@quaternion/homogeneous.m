function h = homogeneous(p)
% HOMOGENEOUS - function to construct or normalise a full quaternion in
% homogeneous coordinates. Given a pure quaternion argument, inserts unity
% scalar part to give a full quaternion result in homogeneous coordinates.
% Given a full quaternion argument, normalises so that the scalar part is
% unity by dividing by the scalar part, and returns the vector part alone.
